# Blog-API Assesment
This repository contains an assesment from AltSchool Africa (BackEnd Engineering Module) on how to build a blog REST API with Node.js and Express.js. Took my tutorial from this [article](https://chinwendu.medium.com/how-to-build-a-restful-blog-api-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb-24a889dec33). Added a pagination to my API for easy navigation and data sourcing.

# General Info

### Question
* The general idea here is that the api has a general endpoint that shows a list of articles that have been created by different people, and anybody that calls this endpoint, should be able to read a blog created by them or other users.

### Endpoints
* After cloning this repo, you may wish to use an API testing platform like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or Thunder Client for VS Code users.
